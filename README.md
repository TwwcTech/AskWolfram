# AskWolfram

AskWolfram is a Python application that leverages the power of the Wolfram Alpha API to answer queries. By inputting a query into AskWolfram, users can receive detailed results directly from Wolfram Alpha's vast computational knowledge engine.

# How to Obtain a Wolfram Alpha API Key

To use AskWolfram, you'll need a Wolfram Alpha API key. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to obtain one:

1. **Register a Wolfram ID**: Visit the [Wolfram|Alpha Developer Portal](^2^) and register for a Wolfram ID if you don't already have one.

2. **Sign In**: Once you've registered, sign in to the Wolfram|Alpha Developer Portal.

3. **Obtain an AppID**: After signing in, click the "Get an AppID" button to start the app creation process. 

4. **Create an App**: Follow the prompts. You'll need to provide some basic information.

5. **Get Your API Key**: Once your app is created, you'll be provided with an AppID, which serves as your API key. This key will be used to authenticate your requests to the Wolfram Alpha API.

Remember to keep your API key secure and do not share it with others. Now, you're ready to use AskWolfram!

Please note that the free access allows up to 2,000 non-commercial API calls per month. For more calls or commercial use, check out the [pricing information](^1^) on the Wolfram|Alpha API page.

## How to Use AskWolfram

When you run **AskWolfram** for the first time, it will ask you for the Wolfram Alpha API key and will save it to the Registry - **Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\AskWolfram** - if you have entered an incorrect key, you can update it here.

Once you have your Wolfram Alpha API key, you can input it into the AskWolfram application. Simply input your query, and AskWolfram will output the results directly from Wolfram Alpha's computational knowledge engine.

We hope you enjoy using AskWolfram and find it a valuable tool in your computational toolkit!
